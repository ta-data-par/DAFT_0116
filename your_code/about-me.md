I'm Vito from Paris
I'm a music composer / sound designer
I studied programming a few years ago

I needed to get a stable job, so that's why I came to Ironhack
I expect too learn a lot about programming, statiistics, decision making and son on

I don't know in which industry I'd like to work yet 
I hope I'll be working as a freelance so I can developp my own stuff on my freetime
